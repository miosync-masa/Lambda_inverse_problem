# Lambda³ Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection: Noto Earthquake Analysis (F-net, Jan 1, 2024)

---

## ❗ Request for Help & Collaboration

Hi all,

I'm an independent researcher working on an open-source anomaly detection model called **Lambda³ Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection**. I applied it to F-net seismic data from the Noto earthquake (Jan 1, 2024, 13:00–16:20 JST), and was able to uncover a number of surprising insights—even working entirely alone.

However, I've truly reached the limits of what I can do by myself.  
This work needs a real research team and broader collaboration to go further—ideally, someone willing to review, discuss, build on, or even take over this project entirely.

**All of my code, results, and methodology are fully open and ready to share with anyone interested.**  
If you see the potential here, have expertise, or are simply curious, your participation or leadership would mean a great deal.  
Together, we might take a real step toward practical earthquake forecasting.

## Key Findings (with numbers)

### 1. Epicenter Paradox
- **Wajima (epicenter) anomaly score:** **1.708**
- **Average (Japan Sea side):** **1.916**
- **Wajima’s ranking:** 2nd lowest among all stations (**bottom 20%**)
- **Interpretation:** The epicenter appeared most "normal" structurally, while "anomalies" clustered around it.

### 2. Pre-quake Time Series Patterns
- **Wajima (window 0–8):** 1.431–1.486 (variation: **5.5 points**)
- **Other stations:** 10–20 point variation
- **Coefficient of variation:** Wajima **1.04%** (average: **1.52%**)
- **Interpretation:** Pre-quake at Wajima was unusually quiet and stable.

### 3. Differences in Quiescence
- **Quiescence observed at:** Shibata, Nakagawa, etc.
- **No quiescence at:** Wajima (instead, a slight increase in anomaly score)
- **Interpretation:** Only some areas “quieted down” before the quake—the epicenter didn't.

### 4. Anomaly Jump at Quake Onset
- **Wajima:** **+16.8%** (smallest jump)
- **Shibata:** **+46.6%**
- **Nakagawa:** **+53.3%**
- **Interpretation:** The response at the epicenter was much less dramatic than at surrounding stations.

## Lambda³ Theory: Structural Insights

1. **Structural Isolation Point Theory**
    - Wajima acted as a “structurally isolated point” surrounded by higher-anomaly areas.
    - It functioned as a *rigid node* unable to absorb changes from the surrounding regions, leading to continuous energy accumulation and, ultimately, rupture.

2. **A New Understanding of Earthquake Mechanisms**
    - **Traditional view:** Stress accumulates → reaches a limit → rupture (earthquake).
    - **Lambda³ view:** Structural instability propagates through the network → concentrates at isolated points → *phase-transition-like rupture*.
  
3. **True Meaning of Anomaly Scores**
    - **High score** = structural flexibility = energy dissipation = *safer*
    - **Low score** = structural rigidity = energy accumulation = *riskier*

## Revolutionary Paradigm Shift

1. **Shift in Monitoring Strategy**
    - ❌ Focusing on dense observation *only* near the epicenter
    - ✅ Monitoring **structural changes across a wide-area network**

2. **Redefining Precursors**
    - ❌ Growth in anomalies as a warning sign
    - ✅ “**Lack of anomalies**” as a *true danger sign*

3. **New Interpretation of Quiescence**
    - Quiescence = energy-release function (safer)
    - Lack of quiescence = structural rigidity (most dangerous)

> These insights suggest a **completely new approach to earthquake prediction and monitoring**, focusing on the structural dynamics and network effects—**not just local anomalies**.

## Open Scientific Questions / Challenges

- **Integration of Subsurface/Geological Models:**  
  How can we incorporate local ground properties and geotechnical features into the Lambda³ analysis framework?
- **Nonlinear Threshold Systems:**  
  What is the best way to identify and model nonlinear thresholds in the onset and propagation of anomalies?
- **Analysis by Earthquake Type (Key Priority):**
    - **Subduction-type (e.g., Tohoku) vs. Inland-type (e.g., Noto)**
    - **Plate boundary events vs. active fault events**
    - Can we clarify and classify **Lambda³ patterns specific to each earthquake type**?

> *If you have expertise in any of these areas, or data/insights related to these scientific challenges, your input would be extremely valuable!*

## Why I Need Help

- Integrating more networks (Hi-net, K-net, S-net, GEONET, etc.) is critical, but it's far too much for one person.
- Real-time processing, data fusion, and nonlinear system modeling are big challenges.
- This could revolutionize earthquake monitoring—but only with open collaboration.
  

## A Personal Note from the Author

As an independent researcher with no academic affiliation, it’s extremely difficult to get support or meaningful collaboration in Japan—even when the scientific potential is clear. No matter how promising the findings or ideas, being outside academia means I’m rarely taken seriously, and progress is painfully slow on my own.

Still, I genuinely hope that someone will take over this research and push it further.  
With just the Lambda³ Zero-Shot model and F-net data, even working alone, I’ve been able to uncover these findings. But if a real research team at a university or institute—using Japan’s extensive sensor network—could apply these methods systematically, I truly believe **practical earthquake forecasting might be within reach**.

Right now, my biggest limitations are equipment, computing resources, and time; these are things a dedicated research group could easily overcome.  
So I would be incredibly grateful if someone could **pick up this project—review, discuss, continue, or even lead it forward**.

**All code, results, and methods are fully available and ready to share.**  
If you have interest, expertise, or even just curiosity, please reach out.  
Together, we might take a real step toward practical earthquake prediction.
